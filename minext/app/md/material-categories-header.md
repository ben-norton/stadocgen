This document is intended to provide a summary of how the terms in the Mineralogy Extension are scoped to either the Specimen or Mineral level. 
This document is not part of the standard. It draws on the term names and definitions from the normative part of the 
standard and combines them with comments and examples that are not normative, but that are meant to help people to use 
the terms consistently. Comprehensive metadata for current and obsolete terms in human-readable 
form are found in a list of terms document. <em>List of files and types</em> can be found in the Mineralogy Extension repository.

## Compound Specimen Model
### Key Definitions

Compound Specimen
: A collection object comprised of one or more discernible parts, called constituent parts, unified by physical attachment. The object's identity is determined by its constituent parts, which are distinguished from one another within a specific context.

Constituent Part
: Physically discernible and proximal parts of a compound specimen identified by a single determination based on physical and chemical exclusivity relative to the parent specimen.

Compound Specimen Model
: A conceptual data model in which a single physical object, a compound specimen, is composed of and defined by its constituent parts.
